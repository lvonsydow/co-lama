# Co-lama - the Colima helper app

![Header](lama.png)

## This is a simple app that visualises basic Colima and docker stuff.

### Stuff it can do
  - Start and stop Colima
  - Show if the docker deamon is running
  - Send great and informative push notifications..
  - Can also manage available containers (start, stop and list)  

---

### How to install
Co-lama is a small desktop app for MacOS but som dependencies are required.
    1. Colima installed and ready
    2. Docker installed and ready
    3. Python3 installed and ready

The app can only handle if Colima and Docker are installed on the same path, so if you installed both with brew without any shananigans it should (*money in the should yar..*) work. Do you know the path to where brew installs its packages by heart or if you could find it before running the app, it would be **great**!

Last thing you will have to do is clone the repo - cd your way into it and run 
```sh
make install
``` 

and the app should be ready to go!

### But wait.. how do I use it?

It is simple!
Open the app like you would and it will appear in the top menu of your app.
There will be a couple of pop ups asking you stuff so allow those if you can.
